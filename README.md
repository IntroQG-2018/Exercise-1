# Exercise 1: Coding and visualizing geostatistics

In this week's exercise we will take our first steps toward learning how to convert equations into Python code, and visualizing some geochronological data.
We will be using Python tools that are already familiar to us, but applying them in a slightly different way than in the earlier exercises.

For each problem you need to modify the given notebook, and then upload your files to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where asked.

- **Exercise 1 is due by the start of class on on 5.11.**
- Don't forget to check out [the hints for this week's exercise](https://introqg.github.io/qg/lessons/L8/exercise-8-hints.html) if you're having trouble.
- Scores on this exercise are out of 20 points.
